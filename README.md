### 📦 Installation Guide (For Dummies)

#### Step 1: Install Python
Maya CLI requires Python. To install Python:
- Download the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Run the installer and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked
- Verify installation by running:
  ```sh
  python --version
  ```

#### Step 2: Install Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Using a virtual environment helps manage dependencies. Install it using:
```sh
pip install virtualenv
```
To create and activate a virtual environment:
```sh
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

#### Step 3: Install Maya CLI
Maya CLI is available on PyPI. Install it using pip:
```sh
pip install maya-cli
```

### 🚀 Usage
Once installed, use the following command to create a new AI project:
```sh
maya create <project_name>
```
Example:
```sh
maya create my_ai_project
```
This will generate the following structure:
```
my_ai_project/
│── data_source/
│   ├── ingestion/
│   ├── processing/
│   ├── storage/
│── knowledge_base/
│   ├── models/
